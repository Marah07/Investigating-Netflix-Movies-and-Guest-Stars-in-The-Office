# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
In this project, I applied the skills learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. We will discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

I also gained experience in an essential data science skill __ exploratory data analysis. This allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I created of the data.
